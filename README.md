## Inspiration
In an increasingly digital world, it's easy to become glued to our screens, losing touch with the natural world around us. Today’s children, in particular, seem to prefer the glow of screens to the wonders of outdoor play. However, adventure awaits us in every corner of nature – from the familiar creatures we encounter daily to the rare and elusive species that spark our curiosity. We are driven by a desire to bridge the gap between technology and the natural world, rekindling our connection with the environment and igniting a sense of wonder and curiosity within us all. Our aim is simple yet profound: to inspire everyone to step outside, explore, and discover the incredible diversity of life on our planet – all in a way that's engaging, educational, and above all, fun!

## What is BioQuest?
BioQuest is a mobile app available for iOS and Android that revolutionizes outdoor exploration. Simply snap a picture of any animal or plant, and our advanced model instantly identifies the species for you. Dive deeper with detailed information about each species and build your own digital journal of encounters. Engage in fun quizzes to test your knowledge and compete with friends, earning points and tracking your progress as you discover and document new species.

## Technologies
Our mobile app consists of three interconnected parts. Our backend model harnesses the power of Intel Developer Cloud, Tensorflow, Python, and OpenCV to accurately identify species from user-submitted images. The backend infrastructure is supported by MongoDB and the Gemini API, with Flask handling the server-side logic. The Gemini model enriches user experiences by generating quiz questions, crafting engaging descriptions, and providing additional species information. These change often, keeping users constantly engaged. On the frontend, we utilized React Native for the mobile app development, while Figma served as our design tool, ensuring a seamless and visually appealing user interface.
